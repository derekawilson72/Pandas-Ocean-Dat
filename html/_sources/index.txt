Welcome to oceanData's documentation!
=====================================

The :ref:`oceanData` module analyzes instrumentation data from NCDC
data sources to create timeseries and statistical plots of wind and wave data.  This analysis uses the Pandas library within Python to apply timeseries analysis, isolate extreme observations, and produce statistical summaries of the data.  graphical results include time series of data and rose plots of wind and wave directions as follows:
